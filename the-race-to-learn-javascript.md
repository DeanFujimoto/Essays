In Computer Engineering, I have never had any experience with the JavaScript language. While we may have experience with C, C++, some assembly languages, and Java; I have never experienced a language that is so easy to use. It seems that JavaScript would be easier to use since it does not require pointers and it does not require specific variable types (as far as I know). Also, there are probably limitations with not being able to call pointers directly. 

In Computer Engineering, we try our best to learn about how the processor communicates with the inputs. Therefore, we tend to focus on addresses and other boring things; it is refreshing to not have to worry about getting NULL pointers. So I much prefer this language to the rest of them and I can see myself using this language much more frequently. 

I do not like the WOD format and the athletic engineering thing. The reason I don't like it is because I think software should be well thought out and take time rather than be a race. While it may be useful for meeting deadlines, it is not how programming should be done in my opinion. I much prefer the old school approach like you would see in shows like Madmen where everyone sits down and discusses what they would like to do while relaxing. From my experience in school, my best work has been done when I see the study session as a hang out rather than a competition.
