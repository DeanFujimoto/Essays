Since highschool, my interests have been in selling software and computer products. Since there will always be a market for software, I figured Computer Engineering would be a good field to go into. I do not plan on being a full time software engineering, as I cannot stand coding for long periods of time, but itâ€™s definitely useful to know if I plan on selling the software. 

While I am more interested in the hardware side, I know software far better since computer engineering requires roughly the same amount of ICS classes as electrical engineering classes. I hope this class will expand my knowledge of creating web pages so I can create my own websites. 

In the future, I want to develop great public speaking skills along-side with decent programming skills. This way, when a client asks what I am selling, I will be equipped to answer their questions. This is something I feel the ICS department lacks, many of the students do not develop strong communication skills. I can also see myself programming hardware or creating advertisements for a product, which will require web development.
